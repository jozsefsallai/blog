Well, here we are again! I have made myself a new blog. Not because I think it's cool to have one (well, not only), but also because I want to share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge with the world. üòç 

I've done this before multiple times, with more or less success in terms of maintenance. However, at the time I kept making the same mistake of following other people's blogging style a little too much, so I never felt like the posts truly represent me. Due to this, I lost interest/motivation in maintaining my previous blogs and closed them entirely. I am positive that the same thing will not happen with this blog as I'll try my best to deliver content that reflects me and build the blog under this philosophy.

## Who am I?

In case you missed the information on [my website](https://sallai.me), my name is Joe and I like to do neat things with software! I am somewhere around my 18s and I've always been passionate about software and computers in general.

I remember creating my first computer program in Visual Studio when I was 7 or 8 years old. I think it was a program launcher application of some sort and I remember it having a really rainbow-y background that looked very bad in terms of aesthetics. Erm.. But that was the past. I still wish I had access to my earliest pieces of software, just to see where I started and how far I've gotten. The earliest somewhat-serious program I made and I have the executable of is a basic video player application with playlist support that I wrote around 2012 in VB.NET. I remember making stupid video tutorials on VB.NET around that time too, some of which I still might have in the form of private/unlisted YouTube videos :) 

But yeah, I've been really into technology and programming for nearly 10 years now and I'm kind of glad of the progress I've made in this field. I have forgotten most of the languages I used back then (Object Pascal/Delphi, VB.NET), but I speak a good amount of programming languages/frameworks now. Some of these include, but are not limited to, JavaScript/Node, Python, Go, PHP, Vue, React, C#, C++, etc. and I've learned lots of things about software engineering.

## What is this blog all about?

In case it wasn't obvious from the previous point, a huge part of my posts will be related to programming. They will be listed under the [**dev** category](/categories/dev/). But, of course, this isn't the only thing I'm going to write about! People who know me personally also know that I really like video games and music, so definitely do expect those topics as well! In fact, I have a post that I've planned on writing about a certain video game (P.S.: those who know me personally might also be able to guess which game). Stay tuned for more details ;) My next post will be about how I made this blog (sorta).

I'll also write about personal/real life stuff either under the [flow](/categories/flow/) category or the [irl](/categories/irl/) one.

## It's a wrap!

From this minute on, my blog has started its journey. I'll try to update it as frequently as possible in terms of design, features, and content. If you have any suggestions, drop me a tweet [@jozsefsallaidev](https://twitter.com/jozsefsallaidev)!

Stay awesome!
